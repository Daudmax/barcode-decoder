Welcome to the **Barcode Decoder** repository! This project offers a robust system designed to detect, crop, and decode barcodes from images. Utilizing the power of YOLOv8, this system is trained on a custom barcode dataset and evaluated using precision, recall, and mAP metrics. The implementation leverages the Ultralytics YOLO and Pyzbar libraries, making it a reliable tool for barcode processing.

## Installation

To set up the Barcode Decoder, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Daudmax/barcode-decoder.git
   cd barcode-decoder
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:

   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model**:

   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Daudmax/barcode-decoder/releases) section to download the model file. Follow the instructions to execute the downloaded file.

## Usage

Once you have installed the Barcode Decoder, you can use it as follows:

1. **Run the Detection Script**:

   Use the command below to run the barcode detection on an image:

   ```bash
   python detect.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

2. **View the Results**:

   The script will output the detected barcodes along with their coordinates and decoded values.

3. **Real-Time Detection**:

   For real-time detection using your webcam, run:

   ```bash
   python detect.py --video
   ```

## Dataset

The system is trained on a custom barcode dataset, which includes various types of barcodes in different environments. This diversity ensures that the model generalizes well across different scenarios.

- **Dataset Size**: The dataset contains over 10,000 images.
- **Types of Barcodes**: Includes QR codes, UPC codes, EAN codes, and more.

## Evaluation Metrics

To ensure the effectiveness of the model, we evaluate it using the following metrics:

- **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of the detected barcodes.
- **Recall**: Indicates how many actual barcodes were detected.
- **mAP (Mean Average Precision)**: A comprehensive metric that combines precision and recall.

These metrics provide insights into the model's performance and help in making necessary adjustments.
